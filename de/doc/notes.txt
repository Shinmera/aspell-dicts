The Aspell German 20030222 dictionary is generated from the
igerman98-20030222 dictionary.

The affix file used is combination of the affix file used for the
German and Swiss dictionary found in the original package.  A new flag
was created when the original affix flag for the Swiss affix file was
different from the German affix file.

The source wordlist included affix information, however, affix
compression IS NOT enabled since there is also a phonet file for the
German language.  If you wish to use affix compression simply add the
line:
  affix-compress true
to the file "de.dat".
