The Aspell Slovenian dictionary is based on the MySpell One:

  This Slovenian dictionary was created by (in alphabetical order):
     Amebis, d.o.o.
     Toma"z Erjavec
     Ale"s Ko"sir
     Primo"z Peterlin

  The Slovenian dictionary is covered by the GNU GPL License and
  supports Slovenian language (sl_SI)

  The affix file was adapted by:
  Robert Ludvik, <r@aufbix.org>

  Project was supported in part by Ministry of Information Society (MID,
  Republic of Slovenia) and Linux User Group of Slovenia (Lugos).

  Bug report: <ales.kosir@pingo.org>

Several words ending in '.' were removed because Aspell 0.50 can not
handle them correctly.

Original MySpell README file and affix file can be found in the doc/
directory.
