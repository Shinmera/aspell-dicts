The Aspell Croatian dictionary is based on the MySpell One:

  This Croatian dictionary was created by Denis Lackovic
  <dlackov@linux.hr> and is covered by the GNU LGPL license.

A few words ending in '.' and numbers were removed because Aspell 0.50 can
not handle them correctly.

Original MySpell README file and affix file can be found in the doc/
directory.
