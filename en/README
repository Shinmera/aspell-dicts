This word list is considered both complete and accurate.

This is the English dictionary for Aspell.  It requires Aspell 
version 0.60 or better.

If Aspell is installed and aspell and prezip-bin are all
in the path first do a:

  ./configure

Which should output something like:

  Finding Dictionary file location ... /usr/local/lib/aspell
  Finding Data file location ... /usr/local/share/aspell

if it did not something likely went wrong.

After that build the package with:
  make
and then install it with
  make install

If any of the above mentioned programs are not in your path than the
variables, ASPELL and/or PREZIP need to be set to the
commands (with path) to run the utilities.  These variables may be set
in the environment before configure is run or specified at the command
line using the following syntax
  ./configure --vars VAR1=VAL1 ...
Other useful variables configure recognizes are ASPELL_PARMS, and DESTDIR.

To clean up after the build:
  make clean

To uninstall the files:
  make uninstall

After the dictionaries are installed you can use the main one (en) by
setting the LANG environmental variable to en or running Aspell
with "--lang=en".  You may also chose the dictionary directly
with the "-d" or "--master" option of Aspell.  You can chose from any of
the following dictionaries:
  en-variant_0 (american-variant_0 en_US-variant_0 english-variant_0)
  en-variant_1 (american-variant_1 en_US-variant_1 english-variant_1)
  en-variant_2 (english-variant_2)
  en-w_accents (english-w_accents)
  en-wo_accents (en english english-wo_accents)
  en_CA-variant_0 (canadian-variant_0)
  en_CA-variant_1 (canadian-variant_1)
  en_CA-w_accents (canadian-w_accents)
  en_CA-wo_accents (canadian canadian-wo_accents en_CA)
  en_GB-ise-w_accents (british-ise-w_accents british-w_accents 
                       en_GB-w_accents)
  en_GB-ise-wo_accents (british british-ise british-ise-wo_accents 
                        british-wo_accents en_GB en_GB-ise 
                        en_GB-wo_accents)
  en_GB-ize-w_accents (british-ize-w_accents)
  en_GB-ize-wo_accents (british-ize british-ize-wo_accents en_GB-ize)
  en_GB-variant_0 (british-variant_0)
  en_GB-variant_1 (british-variant_1)
  en_US-w_accents (american-w_accents)
  en_US-wo_accents (american american-wo_accents en_US)
Whereas the names in parentheses are alternate names for the
dictionary preceding the parentheses.

The individual word lists have an extension of ".cwl" and are
compressed to save space.  To uncompress a word list use 
"preunzip BASE.cwl" which will uncompress it and rename the file 
to "BASE.wl".  To dump a compressed word list to standard output use
"precat BASE.cwl".  To uncompress all word lists in the current
directory use "preunzip *.cwl".  For more help on "preunzip" use
"preunzip --help".

If you have any problem with installing or using the word lists please
let the Aspell maintainer, Kevin Atkinson, know at kevina@gnu.org.

If you have problems with the actual word lists please contact one of
the Word lists authors as the Aspell maintainer does not maintain the
actual Word Lists.

Any additional documentation that came with the original word list can
be found in the doc/ directory.

INFORMATION ON THE PROVIDED DICTIONARIES

This word list package supports the following dialects of English:

  American (en_US)
  British with "ise" spelling (en_GB-ise)
  British with "ize" spelling (en_GB-ize)
  Canadian (en_CA)

In addition generic English (en) is supported which is a combination
of all the above.

For each dialect there is the option to either strip accents (for
example cafe) or keep them (for example caf√©).  The default is to
strip them.

Combining these two options gives the following dictionaries.  

  en_US-wo_accents
  en_US-w_accents
  en_GB-ise-wo_accents
  en_GB-ise-w_accents
  en_GB-ize-wo_accents
  en_GB-ize-w_accents
  en_CA-wo_accents
  en_CA-w_accents
  en-wo_accents
  en-w_accents

in addition to the following aliases:

  en_US = en_US-wo_accents
  en_GB = en_GB-ise-wo_accents
  en_GB-ise = en_GB-ise-wo_accents
  en_GB-ize = en_GB-ize-wo_accents
  en_GB-wo_accents = en_GB-ise-wo_accents
  en_GB-w_accents = en_GB-ize-w_accents
  en_CA = en_CA-wo_accents
  en = en-wo_accents

  american-* = en_US-*
  britsh-* = en_GB-*
  canadian-* = en_CA-*
  english-* = en-*

If you are using Aspell 0.60 these aliases can be changed locally via
"dict-alias" option.  For example if you prefer the "ize" spelling for
British English add the line:

  add-dict-alias en_GB en_GB-ize

to ".aspell.conf".

Great care has been taken so that that, for the most part, only one
spelling for any particular word is included in the main dictionary.
When two variants were considered equal I randomly picked one for
inclusion in the main word list.  Unfortunately this means that my
choice in how to spell a word may not match your choice.  For this
reason the following auxiliary dictionaries are provided:

  en_US-variant_0
  en_US-variant_1
  en_GB-variant_0
  en_GB-variant_1
  en_CA-variant_0
  en_CA-variant_1
  en-variant_2

These dictionaries are meant to be used in addition to one of the
standard dictionaries. To specify them use the "extra-dicts" option.
The "en_*-variant_0" dictionaries includes most variants which are
considered almost equal, "variant_1" includes variants which are
generally considered acceptable, and "variant_2" contains variants
which are seldom used and may not even be considered correct.  It is
only necessary to use on of these dictionaries since, for example,
"en_US-variant_1" includes all the words in "en_US-variant_0".


UPGRADING FROM ASPELL6-EN-0.01

If you are upgrading from the aspell6-en-0.01 package you should do a

  rm `aspell config dict-dir`/en[-_]*.alias

to remove any old alias.  Otherwise aspell may get confused as this
version installs the alias with the ".multi" extension instead of
the ".alias" extension.
