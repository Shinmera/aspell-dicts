This is ALPHA software -- it has about 1400 words, but much work to go.
Volunteers are needed to test and contribute, especially since 
I don't speak gaelic.

To use this dictionary instead of a default (usually English) dictionary,
please set the following:

	DICTIONARY=gaelic.hash
	export DICTIONARY

in your .bashrc; then the 'gaelic' dictionary will be used for spell
checking when using ispell. Please consult the documentation on ispell
for further details.

Ispell will then store additions to your personal dictionary in the
file ~/.ispell_gaelic. Please mail this to me, to be added back to the
main dictionary file. I shall endeavour to release updates as frequently
as possible, probably daily.
