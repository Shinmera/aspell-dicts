The current word list was assembled entirely by statistical 
means applied to a large text corpus harvested by by web crawler
"An Crúbadán":

See the file doc/Crawler.txt for more information.

In particular, Alastair McKinstry's list of about 1600 words
for the Debian package "igaelic" has not been merged in;
it is included in this distribution as doc/igaelic.

Speakers of Scottish Gaelic will notice some idiosyncratic
spelling choices, following, for the most part, Dwelly and
MacBain over the modern sources; e.g.:

féin vs. fèin
as vs às
mór vs mòr
fianuis vs. fianais
fòghlum vs foghlam
chéile vs. chèile

The software attempts to find all potential alternate spellings
and selects a preferred form.  It has surely missed some pairs so 
corrections or additions would be greatly appreciated.
