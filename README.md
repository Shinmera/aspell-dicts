This is a mirror of the [public aspell dictionaries](http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/aspell/dict/), but extracted and thus only including the most recent version. This allows for much easier building and processing.

Use `update.sh` to update the sources to the latest versions that can be downloaded from the above mirror.
