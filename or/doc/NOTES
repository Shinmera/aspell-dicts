This is a very preliminary step at making a usable aspell dictionary for
Oriya. The current version has many shortcomings: (a) the wordlist is limited,
and far from being a real dictionary. It is based on the Rebati glossary of
computer-related terms, and is largely drawn from the GNOME glossary.
(b) support for advanced aspell features like affixes and soundslike is
lacking.
  The complete aspell distribution as well as the source files (in PDf and
UTF-8) for the original Rebati glossary are available from under
http://oriya.sarovar.org/dictionary.html.
