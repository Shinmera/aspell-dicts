  			    BRETON (BREZHONEG) ISPELL DICTIONNARY
				   GERIADUR BREZHONEK EVIT ISPELL


DESCRIPTION :
-------------
This is a breton dictionary for ispell.
To check spelling in brezhoneg text (Latin1 aka ISO-8859 -
though the C'H and CH letters are not present in Latin1 :-) ),


HOW TO USE :
------------
use the following command:
	ispell -d brezhoneg <file_name>

If you always want to use breton dictionnay, then add the following
to your ~/.bashrc

	export DICTIONARY=brezhoneg.hash

Then the 'brezhoneg' dictionary will be used for spell checking
when using ispell. Please consult the documentation on ispell
for further details.

Ispell will then store additions to your personal dictionary in the
file ~/.ispell_brezhoneg. Please mail this to me, to be added back to the
main dictionary file. I shall endeavour to release updates as frequently
as possible.
