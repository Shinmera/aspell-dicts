This Norwegian Nynorsk Aspell dictionary was originally "no" but this
was ambiguous, so it was changed to "nn".

The source word list is the same as in Version 0.50 but version 0.50.1
was created from expanding the MySpell dictionary and not the Aspell
one.  As a result the Word List is slightly different.  I am assuming
that the MySpell expansion is more correct.
