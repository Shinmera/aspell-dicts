This package (aspell-pt) is actually a combination of two different
word lists.

From the pt_PT README: This the br.ispell dictionary for Brazilian
Portuguese. It's freely available under the terms of the GNU GPL.

The pt_BR word list did not come with any copyright notice so for right
now I will assume it is under the GPL.
