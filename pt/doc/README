This package (aspell-pt) is actually a combination of two diffrent
word lists.

pt_PT comes from Jose Joao Almeida's Aspell Portuguese dictionary 
(http://natura.di.uminho.pt/~jj/SOURCES/aspell.port.tgz).

A phonet file was also included in the Aspell Portuguese dictionary,
but it did not seam ready for production.

pt_BR comes from the RedHat 7.1 rpm which is based on Conectiva's
ispell-brazilian sub-package (http://www.ime.usp.br/~ueda/br.ispell/).

Documentation that came with these dictionaries can be found in the
BR/ and PT/ directory respectfully.
