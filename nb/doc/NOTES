This Norwegian Bokmål Aspell dictionary was originally "no" but this
was ambiguous, so it was changed to "nb".

The source word list is the same as in Version 0.50 but version 0.50.1
was created from expanding the MySpell dictionary and not the Ispell
one found in an old version of Red Hat.  The MySpell dictionary, for one
reason or another, includes a lot more words.
