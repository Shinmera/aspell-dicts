The original word list of around 24,000 words was produced
by Alastair McKinstry in 1998 and released for use with ispell. 
Alastair's README is included in the doc/ subdirectory of this
distribution.
  The list was cleaned up and extended to about 32000 words
via statistical methods based on a corpus of Manx texts downloaded
by my web crawler "An Crúbadán" in early 2004; see the file 
doc/Crawler.txt or the web page http://borel.slu.edu/crubadan/
for more information.
