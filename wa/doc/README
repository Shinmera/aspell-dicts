This set of data files implements a Walloon dictionary to be used with
the international ispell program, version 3.1.13 or further.

If you want to run the Walloon dictionary, you have to undefine the
NO8BIT macro in the local.h configuration file.


Walloon is a roman language spoken in Wallonia, south of Belgium.

Here is a short description of how this dictionnary works; for more detailed
explanations, in Walloon, read the LEJHOZMU file.

========================================================================

The way ispell works is simple, it defines some rules to derivate words from
stem words in the *.aff file; those rules are regrouped under "flag" entries;
a flag is a set of rules. There are also two kind of flags: suffixes (they
apply to end of a word) and prefixes (they apply to beginning of a word).

Then, a list of words is created, and for each of them none, one or several
flags are appended, so that ispell knows that from that stem word all
combinations produced by the indicated flags will produce a correct word.
That technique allows to provide a smaller list of words (no need to provide
each form for conjugation or plural, gender etc).

The different available flags are:
"v": a suffix flag, it is for verbs, it will derivate all (or near all) the
     verbal forms of regular and "regularly irregular" verbs. Two forms for
     each verb must be given: past participle and 2d person of present tense.
     eg for verb "tchanter" the two forms "tchanté" and "tchantes" are given.
"s": a suffix flag, it tells that the word can have a plural by adding an "s"
     (this one is the simplest rule :) )
"i": a prefix flag, this handle a particularity of Walloon language which is
     the ellision of the first vowel of some words and verbs in some cases
     eg: tchivå -> tchvå, sicole -> scole, comére -> cmére,...
"n": a suffix flag, used mainly with nouns; it creates the plural, feminine,
     and feminine plural from the masculine version.
"a": a suffix flag, used for adjectives. it is almost identical to "n" flag,
     but it adds a rule for the -ès ending of feminine plural adjectives
     before the word.
"r": creates the feminine versions with -resse (eg: braibandî -> braibandresse)
"j": creates a word in -aedje (and its plural -aedjes) from a verb (this
     flag must be used with the past participle form of the verbs)
"t": creates adjectives in -ant from verbs
"c": creates words in -ance from verbs
"m": - for nouns: creates an adverb in -mint
     - for verbs: creates a noun in -mint

"P" and "S" are special entries never used in the wordlist, but that will
suggest several possibilities when an unknown word is found in a text that
may result of a known stem word plus some of the ruls in "P" and "S".
"P" adds some prefixes like dis- ra- raca- ri-
"S" tries various suffixes and derivations, like -åcion, -rece, -mint,
and the euphonic liaison letters -z, -t, -st
