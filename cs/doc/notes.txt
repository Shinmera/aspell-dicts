The word list used corresponds to the file cs.nocwl created with "make
aspell-new" in an yet to released version (20040614) of the ispell-czech
file, sent to me by the author.

The affix file is created using the aff2oo.pl script found in the
misc/ directory.  This script differs from the one proved in the
original ispell-czech package in a number of ways.

Due to the fact that Aspell and Ispell handle case differently when
expanding affixes the expansion a few of the base words in the word
list are different for Aspell and Ispell.  Since I was unsure what
the desirable behavior was I simply removed those affixes using the
comp.pl script which can be found in the misc/ directory.  The output
of this script, which lists the affixes that were removed, is also
included in the file differ.txt.
