The Brazilian Portuguese dictionary for Aspell is a version of the 
OpenOffice.org one. The idea is to avoid forking or duplicate efforts. 
Previously (previously to Aspell 6) the Brazilian Portuguese dictionary for 
Aspell was derived from the Ispell counterpart, but that project is long 
unmaintained. Please visit the spell checking project page at the BrOffice.org 
(Brazilian Portuguese OpenOffice.org) site if you want to report a missing 
word, a misspelled word, or if you are looking for further information on 
credits and new versions:

The script used in the conversion can be found in the doc directory.
